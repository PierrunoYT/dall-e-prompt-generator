# dall-e-prompt-generator
The `promptgenerator.py` script is a Python program that generates prompts for DALL-E, an image generator, using the OpenAI API and the ChatGPT API. The script allows the user to generate a random prompt or a prompt based on specific keywords. The generated prompt is then displayed to the user, along with a count of the total number of image generations.

The script is designed to be easy to use, with a simple menu that allows the user to choose between generating a random prompt or a prompt based on specific keywords. The user can specify the desired length of the prompt, which can be between 5 and 100 words.

The script uses the OpenAI API to generate the prompts, which ensures that the prompts are of high quality and are tailored to the user's needs. The script also uses the ChatGPT API to provide a conversational interface, which makes it easy for the user to interact with the script and generate prompts.

The `promptgenerator.py` script is written in Python and requires several Python packages, including `nltk` and `openai`. The script also requires an OpenAI API key, which can be obtained by creating an account on the OpenAI website.

This script can be useful for a wide range of projects that require image generation, such as computer vision projects, machine learning projects, art projects, game development projects, and graphic design projects. The script can be uploaded to a GitHub repository and shared with other developers, along with a `config.ini` file with instructions on how to set up the OpenAI API key, and a `README.md` file with instructions on how to use the script.

Overall, the `promptgenerator.py` script is a powerful tool for generating prompts for DALL-E, and can help developers save time and effort when working on projects that require image generation.
